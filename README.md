# Noonlight Demo

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate Android coding techniques while using the Noonlight 
dispatch API.

## Materials Used

- Timber logging library; It's extensible and easy-to-use.
- MockK for mocking in unit / UI tests.
- Coroutines and Flow

## Assumptions

- We need fine-grained location permissions to track the individual and respond effectively.
- We do not need to create a custom Theme for Compose. Used MaterialTheme.
